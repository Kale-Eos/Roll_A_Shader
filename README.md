# Roll_A_Shader
###### In tandem with CSULB VGDA projects in being developed during December 2019 - January 2020.
###### Roll A Shader is based on the beginner Unity tutorial, [Roll A Ball](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball-tutorial).

This "game" is a project used as a playground to experiment and play with custom-made movable object-based shaders.
- This uses Unity version, 2019.2.17f1.
- This is using a custom developed camera controller similar to the asset package, [Cinemachine](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/cinemachine-79898).
- This also uses a custom developed audio manager similar to the asset package, [Google Resonance Audio](https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/develop/unity/getting-started) and [Brackey's Audio System](https://youtu.be/u4tmb4YiTDk).

Since, the focus is shader development and response in certain environments, here is a list of the shaders developed and tested.
